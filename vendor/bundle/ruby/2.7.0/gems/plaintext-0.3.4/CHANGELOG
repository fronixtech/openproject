## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.4] - 2021-04-21
- Further relax the rubyzip version requirement to allow 2.x versions
- Fix: Removed --quiet from unrtf arguments. In newer versions this seems to
  suppress the header line which we used as a marker to strip unrtf comments and
  meta data from the command output.

## [0.3.3] - 2019-10-01
- Relax rubyzip dependency. Our usage of rubyzip does not require adressing
  CVE-2019-16892 and thus is fine with 1.2, but applications using this Gem
  might use RubyZIP elsewhere too and thus will want to upgrade to >= 1.3.

## [0.3.2] - 2019-09-02
- Set minimum Nokogiri version to 1.10.4. See CVE-2019-5477.
- Fix encoding issues for PDFs.
- Bump development dependencies to bundler version 2 and
  rake version 12
- Update travis file to use ruby 2.6.4 and bundler 2.0.1

## [0.3.1] - 2019-01-16

### Added
- The max_plaintext_bytes limit introduced in 0.3.0 is now also enforced in the
  zipped XML handlers responsible for office document parsing.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-01-09

### Added
- `:max_plaintext_bytes` option to place an upper limit on the number of bytes
  returned. Also limits the amount of data that is actually read from plain text
  files and external command output to limit memory usage. Set this on the
  resolver object.

### Changed
- the unrtf handler now strips the preamble which unrtf adds to its output.
- text from external command handlers is now converted to UTF-8 before it's returned.
- the FileHandler `text` method signature has been changed by adding an options
  hash to support passing the max_plaintext_bytes limit.


## [0.2.0] - 2018-12-22

### Changed
- relaxed Nokogiri dependency to '~> 1.8' for Redmine 4 (which uses 1.9)


## [0.1.0] - 2018-02-15
- Initial release
